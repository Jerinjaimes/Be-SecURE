# Be-SecURE
Be-SecURE is based on real-time monitoring of individuals to detect both safe social distancing and face masks in public places using public camera system.Be-SecURE is built upon a modern deep learning algorithm, that has been mixed with geometric techniques for building a robust modal that covers three aspects of detection tracking, and validation.It can be implemented effectively in the current situation when the lockdown is eased to inspect persons in public gatherings, shopping malls, schools, offices etc.
